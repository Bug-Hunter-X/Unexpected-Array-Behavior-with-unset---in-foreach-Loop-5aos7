This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to using `unset()` within a `foreach` loop.  The `unset()` function removes an element from an array by its key. However, when used inside a `foreach`, the iteration may skip elements unexpectedly. The provided `bug.php` showcases this unexpected behavior, and the solution `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected approach using alternative methods like `array_filter` for safer array manipulation.
